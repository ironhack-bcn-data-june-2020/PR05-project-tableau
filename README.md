# Project: Business Intelligence with Tableau

I used a data set with the global and regional sales of video games from 1981 until 2016.

I created the following sheets:
    - Gross Global sell per Developer.    
    - Sells 30- Global-EU-JP-NA-Others.
    - Best Seller Games by Genre.
    - Gross Sales per Year/Genre.
    - 40 best games.
    - Gross Sales per Genre and Developer.
    - Proportion of sales by region.
    
## Conclutions

Our sales conclusion is that Nintendo, EA, and Ubisoft have the best global sales. Most video game sales in a period of time were between 2001-2015. The games most rentability in terms of sales per genre are Action, Sports, and Shooter. The bests game sales were Wii Sports, Grand Theft Auto V, and Super Mario Bros. In the base of the gross sales by genre per developer, I could say that Nintendo could sell different types of genre games in comparison with EA sports that the gross sales are coming from sports games. The proportion of sales by region said to me that the most percentage of gross global sales of video games is in North America.
