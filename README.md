# Project: Business Intelligence with Tableau

## Overview

On this project I used a Data Set from the last project. I analyzed sales from January to Augost 2020 per month, quantity of product and type of buyer. In the different graphs we can see how online sales increased exponentially after COVID-19 and how physical sales goes down. 

I used Tableau to display all the visualization for this project.

## Deliverables

I made different graphs: 

1. A bar graph showing quantity of sales per model and sizes. With that herarqui
2. A line graph showing the evolution of total sales per month by type of store of the sale. I included filters to compare them.
3. A table where you can see the % differential sales divided per model comparing current month with last month. 
4. A table showing how many units were sold in different stores and who bought it. Person or company.
