# Project: Data Viz w Tableau - Everything my phone knows about my unhealthy phone use habits (that I don't). 

## Overview

Probably since always, but mostly since 2020 and lockdown entered my life, I have developed a more dependent and unhealthy (At least for me) habit. Checking up my phone. Too much I believe. But I have always tried to proved wrong and always believed it wasn't as bad. 

The goal of this project is for me to become comfortable with visualization and storytelling, and also, to become aware of several things : 
- My phone stores too much information about myself that I am not aware of.
- And that yes, I should put my phone down more often. 

You will find the storytelling and every decisive data in my Tableau dashboard and worksheet.

Here you can find my project result : https://public.tableau.com/profile/paula3345#!/vizhome/PR05_Tableau_Myphoneusage/Mynotsohealthyphonehabits

I have find inspiration from these two sites: 
- First, from Atharva Jakkanwar in Medium, who wrote about a similar project here: https://towardsdatascience.com/andorid-activity-1ecc454c636c
- For the visualization part I looked up to Feltron's annual reports : http://feltron.com/FAR09.html

The dataset I got it from my Google account in the My activity part. I tried web scraping but ended working with json files directly. You can find here how you can download yours if you have and Android. https://takeout.google.com/?hl=es
