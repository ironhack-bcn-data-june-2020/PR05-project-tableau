## Data
The data used has been obtained with the API used in the third project. It includes all the launches since 1961 until nowadays, including the planned for the next months.

Once the data from the launches was obtained, I have created another CSV file that includes for each location its coordinates (latitude and longitude).

## Project Description
The project consists of a little overview of how many rocket launches there have been since 1961 all around the world and what kind of missions they were for.

## Organization
The structure in the repository is the following:
- Data: folder containing the datasets used
- Notebooks: folder containing the notebook used to generate the locations csv file
- README.md: this file
